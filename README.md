 Project: Etch-a-Sketch from The Odin Project Foundations course

This is the fourth project from The Odin Project Foundations course. The objective of this project is to put into practice the DOM manipulation skills acquired in the last couple of lessons. 

The requirements of the project were:

* Create a N*N grid of square divs
* Set up a hover effect that changes the background color of those divs, leaving a pixelated trail behind
* Add a button that prompts the user to change the number of squares per side. The old grid deleted and the new one generated in the same total space as before (i.e. the more squares there are, the smaller they become)
* Extra credit for the project:
    - Make the color of the pixelated trail be random and change with each interaction
    - Add a progressive darkening effect with each interactions instead of always having the same opacity

## About The Odin Project

> The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
